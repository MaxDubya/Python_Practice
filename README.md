### Before you start coding

Before you begin make sure that you pull the code from the repo on github
To Pull:

- Use the third tab down and hit the three dots and select pull.
- The second option is to hit Control + Shift + P and type pull.

## Start Here

- To start go over the variables.py file. We went over this the first day that we talked about coding you can review that and add to it as much as you yould like.
