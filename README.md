- [] In the Variable_Naming folder there is a file called variable_practice.py. Start there, there are some excercies in it to get you going on variable naming and use.

- [] Once you are done with variable naming move on to the functions folder. In there are some functions that you will have to write the logic inside of in order to pass a se of tests that I have written.
