## Before you start coding

Before you begin make sure that you pull the code from the repo on github.

To Pull:

- Use the third tab down and hit the three dots and select pull.
- The second option is to hit Control + Shift + P and type pull.

# Begin here after you pull the code

- In variables.py I have put some excersices to work on with naming varibles. I will continue to add some over the next few days.
- In start_here.py I will have a few function challenges that you can try to get the functions to get the outcome that you want.
- WIP | I will continue to add to the code and we can work from here. If you want me to add anything to the Markdown file let me know I can add pictures of things I didnt go over well.
