# This file will be to practice your variable naming and manipulation. This is all going to be very simple and is not about the math.
# This is an excercise to get you comfortable with the naming and typing of variables.

#   1. 4 birds are sitting on a branch. 1 flies away. How many birds are left on
#     the branch?

# Example

initial_birds = 4
birds_flew_away = 1
remaining_birds = initial_birds - birds_flew_away

# You dont have to print it. This is to just get you used to naming things and using variables. You can just to see the outcome if you would like.
# With this excercise you can just hit the play button up top and it will run it in the terminal below. Or use a seperate window if you want.
print(remaining_birds)

# ***Challenge Problems***
# You may have to do some google driven development to figure these out.

# Bill and Jill are house painters. Bill can paint a 12 x 14 room in 2.15 hours, while Jill averages
# 1.90 hours. How long will it take the two painter working together to paint 5 12 x 14 rooms?
# Hint: Calculate the hourly rate for each painter, combine them, and then divide the total walls in feet by the combined hourly rate of the painters.
# Challenge: How many days will it take the pair to paint 623 rooms assuming they work 8 hours a day?.


# Create and assign variables to hold your first name, last name, and middle initial. Using concatenation,
# build an additional variable to hold your full name in the order of last name, first name, middle initial. The
# last and first names should be separated by a comma followed by a space, and the middle initial must end
